# Managing Employee Performance and Satisfaction Data

## Project Overview
This project is aimed at designing and implementing a comprehensive SQL database system for managing employee performance and satisfaction data. The system facilitates efficient data storage, retrieval, and analysis to support HR decision-making processes.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Integration**: Combining employee demographics, education, performance ratings, and satisfaction levels into a unified database.
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed analysis of employee metrics such as job satisfaction, manager ratings, and training opportunities.
- **Satisfaction Tracking**: Monitoring employee satisfaction across different dimensions (work environment, job, relationships).
- **Advanced Querying**: Supporting complex SQL queries, aggregations, and joins for data insights.
- **Reporting**: Generating reports summarizing key metrics for departments and roles.
- **Decision Support**: Helping HR and management with data-driven decisions regarding promotions, training, and retention.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Schema**: Well-structured schema with tables for employee details, education levels, performance, and satisfaction ratings.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data integrity using primary and foreign keys with appropriate data types and constraints.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Complex queries for detailed data analysis and insights.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Automating tasks through stored procedures and functions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Optionally providing a front-end interface for HR to interact with the database.

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional SQL database for storing and managing employee-related data.
- Advanced data analysis capabilities to uncover trends and insights.
- Enhanced HR decision-making through reports and data visualizations.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Dataset Selection**: Follow the step-by-step guide to select and download datasets from Kaggle.
2. **Database Setup**: Install MySQL and set up the database schema as per the project's design.
3. **Data Import**: Import datasets into the database using MySQL Workbench.
4. **Query Development**: Perform advanced SQL queries for analysis and reporting.

## SQL Schema & Queries
The database schema includes tables for `Employee`, `PerformanceRating`, `EducationLevel`, `RatingLevel`, and `SatisfiedLevel`. The project also implements various advanced SQL queries, such as:
- Listing the top 3 highest-paid employees by department.
- Calculating cumulative salaries within departments.
- Finding employees with more than 5 years at the company.
- Calculating department-wise average job satisfaction.

## Conclusion
This project provides a robust SQL database system for managing and analyzing employee performance and satisfaction data, significantly improving HR's decision-making processes and organizational effectiveness.
